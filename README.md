# Drone-Based Disaster Damage Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on post-disaster damage assessment using drone-captured aerial imagery. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system aims to identify and localize damaged structures to assist emergency response and recovery planning.

## Motivation
Natural disasters often cause widespread structural damage, and manual assessment can be slow and resource-intensive. Drone-based vision systems enable faster and safer assessment of affected areas, especially in regions that are difficult to access immediately after a disaster.

## System Architecture
1. Drone-based aerial image acquisition  
2. Image preprocessing (noise reduction, resizing)  
3. Damage detection using computer vision / deep learning models  
4. Visualization of damaged regions for analysis  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Deep Learning models (CNN / YOLO – planned)  

## Dataset
- Publicly available aerial imagery datasets  
- Simulated pre- and post-disaster images  

## Results
- Successful identification of damaged regions from aerial imagery  
- Initial qualitative evaluation of detection performance  

## My Contribution
- Designed the overall system workflow  
- Implemented image preprocessing pipeline  
- Worked on damage detection logic and result visualization  

## Future Work
- Improve detection accuracy using advanced deep learning models  
- Integrate real-time drone feed processing  
- Deploy edge-based inference for faster response
